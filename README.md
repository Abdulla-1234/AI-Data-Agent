# AI Data Agent

A sophisticated AI-powered data analysis application that allows users to ask natural language questions about their data and receive intelligent insights with visualizations.

This project uses a React/TypeScript frontend and a Python (FastAPI) backend with LangChain and Google's Gemini AI to perform real-time, AI-driven data analysis.

## Features

- **Natural Language to SQL**: Converts plain English questions into precise SQL queries.
- **Real AI Analysis**: Uses Google's Gemini AI via LangChain to analyze a messy, realistic SQLite database.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: The AI intelligently selects the best chart type (bar, line, pie, table) and formats the data for visualization.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A modern, responsive chat-based UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Handles Bad Schemas**: The AI is capable of navigating cryptic table/column names and dirty data (mixed formats, nulls, etc.).

## Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Recharts for charts.
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI for the web server.
- **AI Agent:** LangChain's SQL Agent to generate and execute queries.
- **LLM:** Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash-latest) for reasoning and response formatting.
- **Database:** SQLite with an intentionally messy and challenging schema.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Install**
```bash

git clone https://github.com/Abdulla-1234/AI-Data-Agent.git
cd ai-data-agent
npm install
```

2. **Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Open Application**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - The application will hot-reload as you make changes

## ðŸ’» Usage

### Example Questions to Try:
- "How many users do we have?"
- "What are the product categories?"
- "Show me the top 3 most expensive transactions. The price is in the 'val' column and is a string with dollar signs and commas."
- "Show me the number of users by region in a bar chart."
- "Which product category has the most sales?"
- "Summarize user signups by month. The signup date is in the signup_dt column and has multiple formats."

## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

### 1.Backend Setup
**1. Navigate to the backend directory:**
```bash
cd backend
```
### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Set up your API Key:**
- Create a file named `.env` inside the `backend` folder.
- Add your Google API key to it: `GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"`
- **Important:** Ensure the "Generative Language API" is enabled for your key in the Google Cloud Console.

### Generate the database:
- Run this script once to create the `analytics.db` file.
```bash
python setup_database.py
```
### 2. Frontend Setup
**1. From the project root directory (not the backend folder), install npm packages:**
```bash
npm install
```
### Running the Application
You will need to run two servers simultaneously in two separate terminals.

Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server
- Navigate to the `backend` directory.
- Ensure your virtual environment is active (you should see `(venv)` at the prompt).
- Run the Uvicorn server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- The backend will be running at `http://localhost:8000`. Leave this terminal running.

### Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Server
- Open a new terminal.
- Navigate to the project root directory.
- Run the Vite development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
- The frontend will open at `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your web browser.
